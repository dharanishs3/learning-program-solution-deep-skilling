Understanding Asymptotic Notation and Search Algorithm Analysis

Big O Notation:
Big O notation is a way to describe how the performance of an algorithm changes as the input size increases. 
It helps us analyze the time or space complexity of an algorithm in terms of input size (n). 
For example, O(n) means the algorithm’s runtime grows linearly with the size of the input, while O(log n) means it grows much slower, even as the input becomes large. 
This is crucial for comparing algorithms and choosing the most efficient one for large datasets.

Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios:
- Linear Search:
  - Best Case: O(1) – if the target is the first element.
  - Average Case: O(n/2) – if the target is somewhere in the middle.
  - Worst Case: O(n) – if the target is at the end or not present.

- Binary Search:
  - Best Case: O(1) – if the target is exactly in the middle.
  - Average/Worst Case: O(log n) – because it keeps halving the search space until the item is found or the list is exhausted.

Time Complexity Comparison:
- Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), meaning its performance degrades as the dataset grows.
- Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which makes it significantly faster for large datasets —
  but only when the data is sorted.

Which is More Suitable for the Platform and Why?
  For our e-commerce platform, binary search is ideal when searching by unique identifiers like product ID 
because the list can be sorted and performance matters at scale. However, for fields like product name or 
category — where duplicates exist or sorting isn’t practical — linear search is better suited due to its flexibility. 
Therefore, a hybrid approach using both types depending on the field is most effective.
